# Florence Nightingale Data Viz Challenge 

This was my entry to a competition run by the Young Statisticians Section of the Royal Statistical Society to mark the bicentenary of the birth of Florence Nightingale.


The challenge was to recreate one of Florence's famous rose diagrams showing mortality of soldiers during the Crimean war.


I won a prize for the most innovative FloViz!
